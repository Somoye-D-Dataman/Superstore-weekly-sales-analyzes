3. What is the total (sum of) sales and quantity sold per country?
4. What product sales most in the store?

2. From the graph it was discovered that the most sale were carried out on Tuesday then followed by Friday and Monday with $154177.4, $60960.9 and $55800.7 respectively.  (NOTE: sales quantity was done using  SUMIF e.g. =SUMIF(F1:F538364, N5, K1:K538364), the total (sum of) quantity of products ordered was uniform throughout the week. This could be because the start of working week in most countries is Monday while end of working week is Friday hence people are likely to go out during these days and by Tuesday most people would have resumed to work and likely to visit stores during these days. The maximum sale recorded was $13541.33 while the maximum quantity was 1488.
